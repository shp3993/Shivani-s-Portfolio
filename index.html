    <div class="mx-auto" style="width: 200px;"></div>
        <p class="text-center">Hello! I am a local native of New Jersey. Currently attending UPENN Coding Bootcamp online for developing my skills in the technology industry.
        In the past I have attended New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ for my Bachelor's in Business Management. Before that I received
        my Associates Degree in Business Adminstration from Middlesex County College in Edison, NJ. Prior to this program, I was working in medical underwriting after being promoted
        from the accounting department. My background is in business but I have always been interested in the IT industry, which is why I chose to puruse this 
        program. Being able to create something from scratch while being able to collaborate with others is something I look forward to doing in the future. </p>
        <p class="text-center">When I have some free time I enjoy working out and staying active outdoors. You can always find me looking for my next place to travel to and explore. 
        One of my bucket list items is to visit and hike in every National Park in the United States. My favorite National Park from the ones I have visited is 
        Mt. Rainier National Park in Washington for the sheer size and presence of the mountain on the drive up and on the hiking trail that essentially climbs right up to the top.
        Another notable park I hae visited is Crater Lake National Park in Oregon because it is contains the deepest lake in the United States. I was able to jump into it off of a 30 foot cliff, 
        without knowing how to swim but it was well worth the risk. Other than travelling, I like to do relaxing things as well such as sketching, photogrpahy, and cooking. Take a look at some of my travel 
        photos in my portfolio!</p>
